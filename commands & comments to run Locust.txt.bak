Commands for non-GUI mode (running the test in the terminal only):

# The command below indicates the 'base URL' (called the host here) that we are going to run the test against: 
locust --headless --users 10 --spawn-rate 1 --host 'http://172.23.176.159/opencart'

# The command below starts the test in headless mode with 5 users, spawn rate of 1
# -i option here is supposed to define the number of iterations for each task, so if want to run each task only a certain
# number of iterations rather than run the test endlessly until it's stopped by Ctrl+C, we may want to include the -i
# option in the command. However, -i doesn't seem to work the way I expected. It just repeats the first step of the test
# (the first task in the SequentialTaskSet and never gets to running the rest of the tasks):

locust -f src/OpenCart_Compare_Products_Add_To_Wishlist.py --headless -u 5 -r 1 -i 4


# Below is my go-to version of Locust command that I use to start the test in non-GUI.
# This version runs the python file which includes SequentialTaskSet class.
# SequentialTaskSet is supposed to run the steps of my test (each step being a subtask of SequentialTaskSet) in a
# specific order, in a sequence defined by the code rather than in some random order. But for some reason
# the post request for the account/account endpoint gets executed BEFORE the get request for the account/login endpoint
# even though it should be vice-versa: in my code the task for account/login endpoint is defined
# above the task for post request hitting the account/account endpoint, so I'd expect account/login endpoint to be called
# first, followed by the account/account call.
 
locust -f src/OpenCart_Compare_Products_Add_To_Wishlist_SequentialTaskSet.py --headless --run-time 120s -u 2 -r 1

command to run a python file in the Playwright_module:
locust -f Playwright_module/OpenCart_Compare_Products_Add_To_Wishlist.py

Command to run a Locust test using GUI mode (GUI window appears allowing to set the parameters of the test and control the run):
locust -f src/OpenCart_Compare_Products_Add_To_Wishlist_SequentialTaskSet.py
